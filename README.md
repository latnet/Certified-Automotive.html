# 'Certified Automotive' Basic HTML Web Design
Basic HTML web design, used a car modification company for the scenario.
'Certified Automotive' is a Land Rover modification company used as the main scenario for the web design, it is NOT a real company - though it is similar to 'Twisted Automotive', don't sue me.

Ran and developed using Brackets and VisualStudio Code with Brackets and HTML Extension.
Needs basic design improvements and for the hyperlinks to actualy re-direct to a new webpage.
